# Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard

## Project Overview
An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts customer churn and visualizes insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard. This project demonstrates the complete data science workflow from data generation to executive-level business intelligence.

## Business Problem
Customer churn represents a critical business challenge, with acquisition costs typically 5-25x higher than retention costs. This project identifies at-risk customers and quantifies potential revenue impact to enable proactive retention strategies.

## Key Results
- **Predictive Accuracy**: 85%+ model accuracy using XGBoost
- **Revenue at Risk**: $726,867 identified from potential churners
- **High-Risk Customers**: 261 customers (26.1%) flagged for immediate intervention
- **Overall Churn Rate**: 44.8% predicted churn rate

## Technical Stack
- **Programming**: Python 3.x
- **ML Libraries**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas, numpy
- **Data Processing**: Faker (synthetic data generation)
- **Visualization**: Tableau Desktop/Public
- **Development**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## Methodology

### 1. Data Generation
Created realistic synthetic customer data with 5,000 records including:
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, senior citizen status
- **Account Information**: Tenure, contract type, payment method
- **Services**: Internet, phone, streaming, tech support
- **Usage Metrics**: Monthly charges, support calls, data usage
- **Target Variable**: Churn (Yes/No)

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Created derived features: charges per tenure, service count, high-value indicators
- Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding
- Generated risk-based target variable with realistic business logic

### 3. Model Development
Trained and compared three classification models:
- **Logistic Regression**: Baseline model (85.5% ROC-AUC)
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method (89.2% ROC-AUC)
- **XGBoost**: Best performer (89.6% ROC-AUC)

Selected XGBoost as the production model based on:
- Highest ROC-AUC score
- Strong feature importance interpretability
- Robust handling of imbalanced data

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **Accuracy**: 84.5%
- **ROC-AUC**: 89.6%
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV for robustness
- Generated probability scores and risk categories (Low/Medium/High/Critical)

### 5. Dashboard Development
Created executive dashboard in Tableau featuring:
- **KPI Cards**: Total customers, churn rate, revenue at risk, high-risk count
- **Interactive Filters**: Risk category, contract type, demographics
- **Risk Segmentation**: Customer categorization by churn probability
- **Financial Impact**: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and revenue exposure

## Key Features

### Predictive Model
- Binary classification for churn prediction
- Probability scores (0-100%) for nuanced risk assessment
- Feature importance ranking to identify key churn drivers

### Risk Scoring System
- **Low Risk** (0-30%): Stable customers
- **Medium Risk** (31-60%): Monitor for changes
- **High Risk** (61-80%): Targeted retention needed
- **Critical Risk** (81-100%): Immediate intervention required

### Business Insights
Top churn drivers identified:
1. Month-to-month contracts (high churn correlation)
2. Low tenure (< 12 months)
3. High monthly charges without added services
4. Frequent support calls
5. Electronic check payment method

## Business Impact

### Quantifiable Results
- **$726,867** in at-risk revenue identified
- **261 customers** prioritized for retention campaigns
- **Estimated ROI**: 300-500% if retention costs 20% of CLV

### Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate**: Contact 261 critical-risk customers with retention offers
2. **Short-term**: Implement contract incentives for month-to-month customers
3. **Long-term**: Improve onboarding for customers in first 6 months
4. **Continuous**: Monitor support call patterns as early warning signals

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn faker
```

### Running the Project
```bash
# Generate data
python notebooks/01_data_generation.py

# Train model and generate predictions
python notebooks/02_model_training.py

# Open Tableau dashboard
# Import churn_predictions_dashboard.csv into Tableau
```

## Model Performance Details

### Confusion Matrix
- True Negatives: Correctly identified retained customers
- True Positives: Correctly identified churners
- False Positives: Over-predicted churn (opportunity cost)
- False Negatives: Missed churners (revenue loss risk)

### Feature Importance (Top 10)
1. Tenure (months with company)
2. Monthly Charges
3. Contract Type
4. Total Charges
5. Support Calls
6. Tech Support subscription
7. Payment Method
8. Internet Service type
9. Online Security
10. Total Services subscribed

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
- Synthetic data may not capture all real-world complexities
- Model trained on snapshot data, not time-series
- Limited external factors (market conditions, competitor actions)

### Future Enhancements
1. **Real-time Predictions**: API integration for live scoring
2. **Time-series Analysis**: Incorporate customer behavior trends
3. **A/B Testing Framework**: Measure retention campaign effectiveness
4. **Advanced Models**: Deep learning for complex pattern recognition
5. **Explainable AI**: SHAP values for individual customer explanations
